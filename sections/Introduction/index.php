<h3>An introduction to Backbone design patterns and reusable elements in the WordPress Media experience.</h3>
<p>Backbone is an unopinionated framework to build on top of. It provides basic
	objects (models and views are important to us), while leaving architectural
	decisions to the developer. Peculiarities can be built into a codebase that
	make the code hard to grok. The solution to this? Documentation. </p>
<p>Some knowledge of <a target="_blank" href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone</a>
	is a good idea. Addy Osmani's <a target="_blank" href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/">Developing Backbone.js Applications</a>
	is a solid primer.</p>
