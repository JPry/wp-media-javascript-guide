<h3>An introduction to Backbone design patterns and reusable elements in the WordPress Media experience.</h3>
<p>Backbone is an unopinionated framework to build with, meaning it provides basic objects to build with, while leaving architectural and implementation decisions up to the developer.

<p>Some knowledge of <a target="_blank" href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone</a> is a good idea. Addy Osmani's <a target="_blank" href="http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/">Developing Backbone.js Applications</a> is a solid primer.</p>
